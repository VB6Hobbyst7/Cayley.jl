251	23-Apr-2022	17:04	Philip Swannell	More fixes to the fat-finger snafu.
250	23-Apr-2022	16:48	Philip Swannell	Arrgh. Release 241 had a "fat-finger" error where all capital `E`s in the VBA code were changed to lower case `e`s. That broke only "case-sensitive code" such as code to feed from Bloomberg. Corrected using data from CodeBackups folders.
249	23-Apr-2022	15:13	Philip Swannell	Less instrumentation in SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToFile.
248	22-Apr-2022	16:00	Philip Swannell	StatusBarWrap --> MessageLogWrite.

245	14-Apr-2022	18:41	Philip Swannell	Changes for LiborTransition: JSON file written by SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToFile contains new elements:<LF>1) SwapRates_CCY has new element FloatingLegType which is a vector whose elements are either "RFR" or "IBOR".<LF>2) XccyBasisSpreads_CCY similarly has two new elements FloatingLegType1 and FloatingLegType2.
244	14-Apr-2022	16:37	Philip Swannell	Reinstated VBProject password.
243	14-Apr-2022	15:10	Philip Swannell	Work around for the "All macros may be disabled" errors. See module modDisabledMacrosWorkAround.
242	14-Apr-2022	13:02	Philip Swannell	Reconstructed again - same"all macros may be disabled" error.
241	12-Apr-2022	13:56	Philip Swannell	Each sheet now has section "Libor Transition" containing one datum, namely FloatingLegType with allowed values of RFR and IBOR.
240	12-Apr-2022	11:44	Philip Swannell	Strange - had to copy all worksheets and modules to a fresh workbook to fix "all macros may be disabled" error. This is the second time I've had to do thisn and I haven't been able to figure out the cause.

219	24-Jan-2022	16:19	Philip Swannell	Added call to GetFromRegistry to workbook open event. Not sure why that was not present. Maybe deleted in release 216?
218	18-Jan-2022	17:10	Philip Swannell	Bug fix to SaveFxDataToDictionary.
217	18-Jan-2022	16:27	Philip Swannell	Reinstated password for viewing VBA.

215	18-Jan-2022	14:39	Philip Swannell	More work on SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToFile. For the time being maintaining compatibility so that this workbook will work with both R code and Julia code - that will make comparing results easier.
214	17-Jan-2022	15:45	Philip Swannell	Forked SCRiPT_MarketData to CayleyMarketData, since we may need to make non-backwards-compatible changes.
213	07-Oct-2020	17:15	Philip Swannell	Used Bloomberg from PC at home (tricky with Citrix etc) to update rates to 10-Feb-2020, useful to compare with Xplain.

196	16-Mar-2018	12:55	Philip Swannell	When feeding rates from Bloomberg, can now apply random adjustment to every data point fed (currently +/- 2.5%). Need to do this so we are not sending Bloomberg numbers off the PC on which we have rights to use the Bloomberg data.
195	05-Mar-2018	15:14	Philip Swannell	Change to behaviour of SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToFile when there are no Credits to be saved: Write null rather than [null]

191	21-Feb-2018	16:26	Philip Swannell	Tweaks to previous.
190	21-Feb-2018	16:02	Philip Swannell	Save _all_ funding spreads to the market, not just those for the "chosen banks". Allows FVA calculation for banks other than the chosen banks.

177	17-Jan-2018	11:34	Philip Swannell	Release with data for CoB 16 Jan 2018. Need a flat file format to stop this workbook being a data store.
176	12-Dec-2017	14:24	Philip Swannell	ThrowIfErrorFromR -> ThrowIfError
175	04-Dec-2017	09:02	Philip Swannell	Ran Ribbon Commander Code Cleaner.

153	22-Jun-2017	15:05	Philip Swannell	Re-imported correlation data from workbooks created by Correlation Matrix Generator'. No longer call sNearestCorrelationMatrix on "big" matrix, but will use r function nearPD to correct the correlation matrix passed to R.
152	13-Jun-2017	15:47	Philip Swannell	Fixes to Bloomberg tickers displayed on the currency sheets. Was showing #NAME?
151	13-Jun-2017	14:08	Philip Swannell	Inflation sheets now include estimates of historical vol of the index

145	23-May-2017	11:26	Philip Swannell	Now save historic inflation to R as two columns of data - first column is first of month in Excel convention, second column is index.
144	23-May-2017	10:30	Philip Swannell	Lag -> LagMethod, cont.
143	23-May-2017	10:24	Philip Swannell	Lag -> LagMethod

134	11-May-2017	17:19	Philip Swannell	Cleaned up VBA code via MZTools.
133	11-May-2017	15:20	Philip Swannell	Save Inflation Parameters to R as a list rather than as a character vector.
132	11-May-2017	11:21	Philip Swannell	Now check inflation historic sets are not missing any resets (or have too many). Have a tolerance i.e. expect data to be published by 23rd of month. Also, before saving to R, we transform the seasonal adjustments so that we "cycle" to put the month of the latest historic set at the top of the list and subtract that adjustment from all of the adjustments. Finally flipped the sign convention for SeasonalAdjustments to be in line with AJR's R code.
131	03-May-2017	15:10	Philip Swannell	Changes to method CheckZCInflationSwapsData so that data saved to R is compatible with R method AddCurve.inflation.
130	03-May-2017	11:56	Philip Swannell	Method SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToR now creates input_inflations a vector of the inflation indices required or a zero-length vector if no inflations "in the market".
129	03-May-2017	11:28	Philip Swannell	Correction to method CheckSeasonalAdjustments.
128	03-May-2017	11:11	Philip Swannell	Method SaveDataFromMarketWorkbookToR no longer calculates ALL sheets of this workbook, but only the relevant ones.
127	03-May-2017	11:00	Philip Swannell	Changed seasonal adjustments to show the log of the multiplicative adjustment, so that the 12 should sum to 0 rather than multiply to one, as previously. This is in line with Andrew's approach (though not yet sure if I've adopted the same sign convention).
126	03-May-2017	09:09	Philip Swannell	Added Add-hoc method ForceAllCorrelationsToBeSymmetric and used it to correct the array formulas on the Correlations sheets.

115	25-Apr-2017	17:35	Philip Swannell	More work on inflation sheets, including utility function EstimateSeasonalAdjustment.
114	25-Apr-2017	11:41	Philip Swannell	Added three more inflation sheets.
113	24-Apr-2017	14:06	Philip Swannell	Added sheet UK RPI as prototype.

111	30-Mar-2017	16:45	Philip Swannell	Added method to align cross rates - can be called from menu button on Fx sheet, and we could call it from feeding code...
110	30-Mar-2017	15:15	Philip Swannell	Bug fix to method BloombergTickerFxSpot - was doing the wrong thing is ever the currency pair was in the non-standard order.
109	30-Mar-2017	12:19	Philip Swannell	Tweaks to adding and deleting currency pairs from Fx sheet. Fixed bug in feed basis swaps. Bug introduced in release 104.

105	28-Mar-2017	13:42	Philip Swannell	Changes to support numeraire being either EUR or USD or GBP.
104	28-Mar-2017	11:36	Philip Swannell	Config sheet now has range Numeraire rather than BaseCCY.

88	29-Dec-2016	09:34	Philip Swannell	Reform of sheet Credit: Funding spreads and CDS levels now displayed in the same array and transposed so that each credit curve occupies a row rather than a column - better for displaying a large number of credit curces as needed for the Airbus project.
87	16-Dec-2016	07:10	Philip Swannell	Removed FX data for CHFCAD, CHFGBP, CHFNOK, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, GBPDKK, GBPJPY, GBPNOK, GBPSAR, GBPSEK, USDAED, USDAUD, USDBRL, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDCZK, USDDKK, USDGBP, USDHUF, USDJPY, USDMXN, USDNOK, USDPLN, USDQAR, USDRON, USDRUB, USDSAR, USDSEK, USDSGD, USDZAR

80	13-Dec-2016	14:43	Philip Swannell	Added reference to c:\program files\solum\Addins\SCRiPTUtils.xlam.
79	12-Dec-2016	13:18	Hermione Glyn	For JPY, NOK had to revert to feeding swaps against 6M Libor since swaps against 3M don't seem to be available on Bloomberg.
78	12-Dec-2016	12:55	Philip Swannell	Also feed swaps against 3M Libor for CAD, DKK, HUF, JPY, NOK.
77	12-Dec-2016	12:34	Philip Swannell	For EUR, GBP, CHF now feed swaps against 3M Libor so as to be consistent with index used for cross currency.

75	09-Dec-2016	13:30	Philip Swannell	Removed Stop statement. MZTools to remove declared-but-unused variables. 
74	09-Dec-2016	13:22	Philip Swannell	More tweaks to dialogs in method FeedRatesFromBloomberg.
73	09-Dec-2016	09:20	Philip Swannell	Tweaks to dialogs in method FeedRatesFromBloomberg.
72	02-Dec-2016	14:34	Philip Swannell	Realised that the attempt to fix the "too much data to feed from Bloomberg" problem was doomed, so still have to manually choose about 5 currencies at a time.
71	02-Dec-2016	11:58	Philip Swannell	The menu is now much simpler. Instead of many menu options the user interface to feeding rates from Bloomberg is like a wizard. Also (hopefully) fixed problem with Bloomberg feed that doing too many currencies did not work.
70	01-Dec-2016	18:39	Philip Swannell	Some simplification of the menu structure.
69	01-Dec-2016	17:54	Philip Swannell	Added method ChooseCurrencies. To Do - make the menus simpler!

62	08-Nov-2016	18:20	Philip Swannell	Reversed change 61. RCode now assumes that xccybasis data for the numeraire currency is fixed versus OIS.
61	08-Nov-2016	13:40	Philip Swannell	Bug fix to cross-currency swap pricing - when we save down cross currency swap data (input_XccyBasisSpreads_XXX) have added an extra column IsFixed1 so that we know if leg 1 of the swap is fixed or floating. Requires changes in the R code. Also changed GetCOBDate so that the dialog remembers the last date you typed in.
60	08-Nov-2016	12:36	Philip Swannell	Change to HideUnhideCurrencySheets to reduce screen flicker.
59	05-Nov-2016	14:13	Philip Swannell	Improved error handling in method SaveCurrencySheetToR.

50	13-Oct-2016	15:12	Philip Swannell	Ran release cleanup -  there seems to be a problem with not calling code to autofit columns, presumably when we feed rates from BBG. HG to look at.
49	11-Oct-2016	18:56	Philip Swannell	Added more historic vols with the levels taken from the Cayley workbook

43	04-Oct-2016	17:39	Hermione Glyn	Added ParseBBGFile, FeedAllRatesFromTextFile and FeedSheetFromTextFile to get rates from a |-delimited text file, in menu under "Rates from text file". PasteFromHiddenSheet now shares FormatPastedCells with said functions to avoid duplication of formatting code.
42	31-Aug-2016	13:58	Philip Swannell	Change in method BloombergFormulaFxVol so that vols against EUR for currencies pegged to USD are fed from EURUSD vol.
41	31-Aug-2016	10:55	Hermione Glyn	Added sheets for AED, CZK, HUF, QAR, RON, SAR, ZAR
40	28-Jul-2016	12:22	Philip Swannell	Now call sParseFrequencyString, sParseDCT and sSupportedDCTs from SolumAddin. Reduces code duplication.

30	11-Jul-2016	16:26	Hermione Glyn	Restructured Bloomberg feed code to help us provide a spec to Airbus for feeding from Reuters
